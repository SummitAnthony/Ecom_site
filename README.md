## Learning Outcomes


### 1. Local Storage for Cart Management
In this project, I delved into utilizing the browser's local storage to create and manage the user's shopping cart. It's an invaluable skill, especially for a Django web app, ensuring that data remains accessible even when users close or refresh the page.

### 2. Integration of JavaScript and Django
I focused on seamlessly integrating JavaScript with Django to power our cart functionality. The entire project revolves around JavaScript, Django, and a bit of jQuery for smooth communication between the front-end and back-end. 

### 3. Posting Form Data Directly to the Database
I opted for a straightforward approach to store user-generated content in the backend. By posting form data directly to the database using the POST method in Django views, I collected and validated data on the server side and employed the `save()` method of the Django model.

### 4. jQuery for Front-End User Actions
While acknowledging the availability of more advanced frameworks like Angular or Vue.js, I chose jQuery for its lightweight nature. It's simple yet effective, handling front-end user actions such as dynamic cart updates and form input validation.
